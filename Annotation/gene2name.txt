Mhon_002055	mismatched DNA binding	MLH1
Mhon_002059	Heterodimerizes with Pms2 to form MutL alpha, a component of the post-replicative DNA mismatch repair system (MMR). DNA repair is initiated by MutS alpha (Msh2-Msh6) or MutS beta (Msh2-Msh6) binding to a dsDNA mismatch, then MutL alpha is recruited to the heteroduplex. Assembly of the MutL-MutS- heteroduplex ternary complex in presence of RFC and PCNA is sufficient to activate endonuclease activity of Pms2. It introduces single-strand breaks near the mismatch and thus generates new entry points for the exonuclease EXO1 to degrade the strand containing the mismatch. DNA methylation would prevent cleavage and therefore assure that only the newly mutated DNA strand is going to be corrected. MutL alpha (Mlh1-Pms2) interacts physically with the clamp loader subunits of DNA polymerase III, suggesting that it may play a role to recruit the DNA polymerase III to the site of the MMR. Also implicated in DNA damage signaling, a process which induces cell cycle arrest and can lead to apoptosis in case of major DNA damages. Heterodimerizes with Mlh3 to form MutL gamma which plays a role in meiosis (By similarity)	MLH1

Mhon_004756	Decapping scavenger enzyme that catalyzes the cleavage of a residual cap structure following the degradation of mRNAs by the 3'- 5' exosome-mediated mRNA decay pathway. Hydrolyzes cap analog structures like 7-methylguanosine nucleoside triphosphate (m7GpppG) with up to 10 nucleotide substrates (small capped oligoribonucleotides) and specifically releases 5'-phosphorylated RNA fragments and 7-methylguanosine monophosphate (m7GMP). Cleaves cap analog structures like tri-methyl guanosine nucleoside triphosphate (m3(2,2,7)GpppG) with very poor efficiency. Does not hydrolyze unmethylated cap analog (GpppG) and shows no decapping activity on intact m7GpppG-capped mRNA molecules longer than 25 nucleotides. Does not hydrolyze 7-methylguanosine diphosphate (m7GDP) to m7GMP. May also play a role in the 5'- 3 mRNA decay pathway	-

Mhon_007663	microtubule-severing ATPase activity	spas
Mhon_007663	ATP-dependent microtubule severing protein that specifically recognizes and cuts microtubules that are polyglutamylated. Preferentially recognizes and acts on microtubules decorated with short polyglutamate tails severing activity increases as the number of glutamates per tubulin rises from one to eight, but decreases beyond this glutamylation threshold. Severing activity is not dependent on tubulin acetylation or detyrosination. Microtubule severing promotes reorganization of cellular microtubule arrays and the release of microtubules from the centrosome following nucleation. It is critical for the biogenesis and maintenance of complex microtubule arrays in axons, spindles and cilia. SPAST is involved in abscission step of cytokinesis and nuclear envelope reassembly during anaphase in cooperation with the ESCRT-III complex. Recruited at the midbody, probably by IST1, and participates in membrane fission during abscission together with the ESCRT-III complex. Recruited to the nuclear membrane by IST1 and mediates microtubule severing, promoting nuclear envelope sealing and mitotic spindle disassembly during late anaphase. Required for membrane traffic from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi and endosome recycling. Recruited by IST1 to endosomes and regulates early endosomal tubulation and recycling by mediating microtubule severing. Probably plays a role in axon growth and the formation of axonal branches	spas

Mhon_008064	inhibitory protein 1	-
Mhon_008065	E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase that plays a key role in DNA damage signaling via 2 distinct roles by mediating the 'Lys-63'- linked ubiquitination of histones H2A and H2AX and promoting the recruitment of DNA repair proteins at double-strand breaks (DSBs) sites, and by catalyzing 'Lys-48'-linked ubiquitination to remove target proteins from DNA damage sites. Following DNA DSBs, it is recruited to the sites of damage by ATM-phosphorylated MDC1 and catalyzes the 'Lys-63'-linked ubiquitination of histones H2A and H2AX, thereby promoting the formation of TP53BP1 and BRCA1 ionizing radiation-induced foci (IRIF). Also controls the recruitment of UIMC1-BRCC3 (RAP80-BRCC36) and PAXIP1 PTIP to DNA damage sites. Also recruited at DNA interstrand cross-links (ICLs) sites and catalyzes 'Lys-63'-linked ubiquitination of histones H2A and H2AX, leading to recruitment of FAAP20 and Fanconi anemia (FA) complex, followed by interstrand cross-link repair. H2A ubiquitination also mediates the ATM-dependent transcriptional silencing at regions flanking DSBs in cis, a mechanism to avoid collision between transcription and repair intermediates. Promotes the formation of 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitin chains via interactions with the specific ubiquitin-conjugating UBE2N UBC13 and ubiquitinates non-histone substrates such as PCNA. Substrates that are polyubiquitinated at 'Lys-63' are usually not targeted for degradation. Also catalyzes the formation of 'Lys-48'-linked polyubiquitin chains via interaction with the ubiquitin- conjugating UBE2L6 UBCH8, leading to degradation of substrate proteins such as CHEK2, JMJD2A KDM4A and KU80 XRCC5 it is still unclear how the preference toward 'Lys-48'- versus 'Lys-63'-linked ubiquitination is regulated but it could be due to RNF8 ability to interact with specific E2 specific ligases. For instance, interaction with phosphorylated HERC2 promotes the association between RNF8 and UBE2N UBC13 and favors the specific formation of 'Lys-63'-linked ubiquitin chains. Promotes non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) by promoting the 'Lys-48'-linked ubiquitination and degradation the of KU80 XRCC5. Following DNA damage, mediates the ubiquitination and degradation of JMJD2A KDM4A in collaboration with RNF168, leading to unmask H4K20me2 mark and promote the recruitment of TP53BP1 at DNA damage sites	-

Mhon_010719	Voltage-sensitive calcium channels (VSCC) mediate the entry of calcium ions into excitable cells and are also involved in a variety of calcium-dependent processes, including muscle contraction, hormone or neurotransmitter release, gene expression, cell motility, cell division and cell death. This channel gives rise to T-type calcium currents. T-type calcium channels belong to the low-voltage activated (LVA) group and are strongly blocked by nickel and mibefradil. A particularity of this type of channels is an opening at quite negative potentials, and a voltage- dependent inactivation. T-type channels serve pacemaking functions in both central neurons and cardiac nodal cells and support calcium signaling in secretory cells and vascular smooth muscle. They may also be involved in the modulation of firing patterns of neurons which is important for information processing as well as in cell growth processes	cca-1

Mhon_020752	Acts as NAD-dependent protein lipoamidase, ADP-ribosyl transferase and deacetylase. Catalyzes more efficiently removal of lipoyl- and biotinyl- than acetyl-lysine modifications. Inhibits the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDH) activity via the enzymatic hydrolysis of the lipoamide cofactor from the E2 component, DLAT, in a phosphorylation-independent manner. Catalyzes the transfer of ADP-ribosyl groups onto target proteins, including mitochondrial GLUD1, inhibiting GLUD1 enzyme activity. Acts as a negative regulator of mitochondrial glutamine metabolism by mediating mono ADP-ribosylation of GLUD1 expressed in response to DNA damage and negatively regulates anaplerosis by inhibiting GLUD1, leading to block metabolism of glutamine into tricarboxylic acid cycle and promoting cell cycle arrest. In response to mTORC1 signal, SIRT4 expression is repressed, promoting anaplerosis and cell proliferation. Acts as a tumor suppressor. Also acts as a NAD-dependent protein deacetylase mediates deacetylation of 'Lys- 471' of MLYCD, inhibiting its activity, thereby acting as a regulator of lipid homeostasis. Controls fatty acid oxidation by inhibiting PPARA transcriptional activation. Impairs SIRT1 PPARA interaction probably through the regulation of NAD( ) levels. Down-regulates insulin secretion	Sirt4

Mhon_022345	RNA N6-methyltransferase that methylates adenosine residues of a subset of RNAs and plays a key role in S-adenosyl-L- methionine homeostasis by regulating expression of MAT2A transcripts. Able to N6-methylate a subset of mRNAs and U6 small nuclear RNAs (U6 snRNAs). In contrast to the METTL3-METTL14 heterodimer, only able to methylate a limited number of RNAs requires both a 5'UACAGAGAA-3' nonamer sequence and a specific RNA structure. In presence of S-adenosyl-L-methionine, binds the 3'- UTR region of MAT2A mRNA and specifically N6-methylates the first hairpin of MAT2A mRNA, leading to intron retention and preventing MAT2A mRNA splicing. In S-adenosyl-L-methionine-limiting conditions, binds the 3'-UTR region of MAT2A mRNA but stalls due to the lack of a methyl donor, leading to stimulate splicing of the MAT2A retained intron, and promoting expression of MAT2A. In addition to mRNAs, also able to mediate N6-methylation of U6 small nuclear RNA (U6 snRNA) specifically N6-methylates adenine in position 43 of U6 snRNAs	-

Mhon_022934	Involved in mRNA export coupled transcription activation by association with both the TREX-2 and the SAGA complexes. The transcription regulatory histone acetylation (HAT) complex SAGA is a multiprotein complex that activates transcription by remodeling chromatin and mediating histone acetylation and deubiquitination. Within the SAGA complex, participates to a subcomplex that specifically deubiquitinates histones. The SAGA complex is recruited to specific gene promoters by activators, where it is required for transcription. The TREX-2 complex functions in docking export-competent ribonucleoprotein particles (mRNPs) to the nuclear entrance of the nuclear pore complex (nuclear basket). TREX-2 participates in mRNA export and accurate chromatin positioning in the nucleus by tethering genes to the nuclear periphery	e(y)2

Assembling component of the TREX complex which is thought to couple mRNA transcription, processing and nuclear export, and specifically associates with spliced mRNA and not with unspliced pre-mRNA. TREX is recruited to spliced mRNAs by a transcription- independent mechanism, binds to mRNA upstream of the exon-junction complex (EJC) and is recruited in a splicing- and cap-dependent manner to a region near the 5' end of the mRNA where it functions in mRNA export to the cytoplasm via the TAP NFX1 pathway. May undergo several rounds of ATP hydrolysis during assembly of TREX to drive subsequent loading of components such as ALYREF THOC and CHTOP onto mRNA.

Catalysis occurs through a double-displacement mechanism. The nucleophile active site attacks the C1' of nucleotide 34 to detach the guanine base from the RNA, forming a covalent enzyme-RNA intermediate.

Mediates monoubiquitination as well as 'Lys-6', 'Lys-11', 'Lys-48'-linked and 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitination of substrates depending on the context. Participates in the removal and or detoxification of abnormally folded or damaged protein by mediating 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitination of misfolded proteins such as PARK7 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitinated misfolded proteins are then recognized by HDAC6, leading to their recruitment to aggresomes, followed by degradation. Mediates 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitination of a 22 kDa O-linked glycosylated isoform of SNCAIP, possibly playing a role in Lewy-body formation. Mediates monoubiquitination of BCL2, thereby acting as a positive regulator of autophagy. Promotes the autophagic degradation of dysfunctional depolarized mitochondria (mitophagy) by promoting the ubiquitination of mitochondrial proteins such as TOMM20, RHOT1 MIRO1 and USP30. Preferentially assembles 'Lys-6'-, 'Lys-11'- and 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitin chains following mitochondrial damage, leading to mitophagy.

By cleaving mitochondrial fission protein drp-1, may regulate the removal of mitochondria during apoptosis. During germline apoptosis, cleaves translation initiation factor ifg-1 (isoform p170) promoting cap-independent translation. During male tail morphogenesis, promotes apoptosis of the tail-spike cell downstream of ced-4 but independently of egl-1 and ced-9. By cleaving cnt-1, prevents the activation of the prosurvival akt-1 2 signaling pathway and thus promotes apoptosis. Downstream of	-
